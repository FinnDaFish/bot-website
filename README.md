# Can I use this code?
If you want to, using this code would require you to give credit to the owner (Zinto Studios) which is my team and I.

### How would I run this?
Copy the link (Being github.com/FinnDaFish/tts-bot) Then go to https://replit.com/ then make a new project, go to the "Import from github" button then copy the link into there. After that edit the code to whatever you want then run it in html, css etc.
